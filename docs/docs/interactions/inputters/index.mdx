# Inputters

Available Inputters:

- CLI.
- Notebook Cell Extension.
- Notebook Extension.

The types of input for an AI agent depend on the task it is designed for and the modalities it can process. Common types of inputs include:

1. Textual Input
- Natural Language: Plain text, questions, or commands written in human language. Example: "Write a story about a space explorer."
- Structured Data: JSON, XML, or other data formats with structured content. Example: `{"age": 30, "gender": "female", "preferences": ["sports", "music"]}`

2. Visual Input
- Images: Photographs, drawings, or other static visual data. Example: A JPEG of a sunset uploaded for analysis.
- Videos: Sequences of images, often used in tasks like action recognition or video summarization. Example: A 10-second clip of a person playing basketball.
- 3D Data: Point clouds or 3D models used in fields like robotics or virtual reality. Example: A CAD model for object recognition.

3. Auditory Input
- Audio Files: Speech, music, or other sound recordings. Example: An MP3 file of someone saying, "What's the weather today?"
- Live Audio Streams: Real-time audio data for tasks like speech-to-text or sound detection.

4. Sensor Data
- Motion Sensors: Inputs from accelerometers, gyroscopes, or other motion detectors. Example: Data from a fitness tracker measuring steps and activity.
- Environmental Sensors: Inputs like temperature, humidity, or light levels. Example: Data from IoT sensors in a smart home.

5. Numerical or Tabular Data
- Spreadsheets or CSV Files: Inputs for machine learning models used in financial, statistical, or predictive analytics. Example: Sales data for a forecasting model.

6. Multimodal Input
- Combination of Modalities: Inputs that mix text, images, audio, and other formats. Example: A video clip with subtitles analyzed for sentiment and actions.

7. Code
- Programming Code: For debugging, code generation, or analysis. Example: Python code submitted for auto-completion or error checking.

8. Commands or Control Inputs
- Interactive Commands: Inputs from a user interface, voice command, or button clicks. Example: A user saying, "Turn on the lights" to a smart assistant.

9. Contextual Inputs
- State Information: Data about the current context or environment of the AI agent. Example: Current GPS location provided to a navigation assistant.
- Previous Interactions: Memory of prior prompts or actions to enable continuity in conversation or tasks. Example: "Continue the story from where we left off."

10. Real-Time Streams
- Sensor Streams: Continuous input from a camera, microphone, or another sensor. Example: Live video feed for a surveillance AI.

11. Game or Simulation Data
- Game States: Inputs representing the current state in a game or simulation. Example: The configuration of pieces on a chessboard.

12. Logical and Mathematical Inputs
- Formulas or Equations: Mathematical or logical expressions for computation. Example: A quadratic equation to solve.

13. Feedback and Labels
- Supervisory Inputs: Labels or corrections provided by humans for training or refinement. Example: "The generated text is biased; correct it." Each type of input often requires preprocessing or specific handling to make it compatible with the AI system. Multimodal AI systems are capable of handling and integrating multiple types of input for more complex tasks.ntinuity in conversation or tasks.

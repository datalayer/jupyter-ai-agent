Output is a broad term used to describe any result generated by the AI, whether it's text, an image, or another format. The result of an AI prompt is often referred to based on the type of output it produces or the context in which it is used.

- Response: A general term used when the AI provides a textual reply or answer to the input prompt.
- Completion: In contexts like text generation with models like OpenAI's GPT, it is called a completion because the AI completes the input provided.
- Generation: This term is used when the AI creates something new, like text, images, music, etc.
- Artifact: A term sometimes used in artistic or creative contexts to describe the produced work, especially in image generation.
- Result: A simple and generic term for the outcome of running a prompt.

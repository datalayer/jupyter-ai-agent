# Use Cases

The available [Agents](/docs/agents) support following use cases.

- **Automated Data Analysis** - Generate and execute Python scripts to analyze data, create visualizations, or preprocess datasets.
- **Error Debugging** - Identify and explain errors in code execution, with actionable suggestions to fix them.
- **Notebook Refactoring** - Automatically optimize code structure, improve readability, or add detailed documentation.

We are building new Agents to support more use cases.

- **Creating a UI for Chatting with the Agent in JupyterLab** - Developing an interactive interface within JupyterLab 
where users can directly communicate with the Jupyter AI Agent, issuing commands and receiving real-time responses 
in a conversational format.
- **Building a Code Refactoring Agent** - Developing an agent that can automatically refactor code in Jupyter Notebooks,
improving code quality, readability, and maintainability.

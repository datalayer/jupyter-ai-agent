# Jupyter AI Agent

Jupyter AI Agent empowers **AI** models to **interact** with and **modify Jupyter Notebooks**. The model is equipped with tools such as adding code cells, inserting markdown cells, executing code, enabling it to modify the notebook comprehensively based on user instructions. This agent is **innovative** as it is designed to **operate on the entire notebook**, not just at the cell level, enabling more comprehensive and seamless modifications.

This powerful functionality is made possible through [jupyter-nbmodel-client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-nbmodel-client) and [jupyter-kernel-client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client), enabling interaction with Jupyter notebooks and kernels.

# Overview

Jupyter AI Agent is a flexible and powerful framework for **using and creating AI agents ðŸ¤–** to **interact with Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ““**. 
With intelligent tools like `execute_cell`, `insert_cell`, and others, Jupyter AI Agent transforms your notebooks into an interactive, AI-powered workspace that adapts to your needs! âœ¨

Jupyter AI Agent empowers **AI models** to **interact** with and **modify Jupyter Notebooks**. The agent is equipped with tools such as adding code cells, inserting markdown cells, executing code, enabling it to modify the notebook comprehensively based on user instructions or by reacting to notebook and kernel events.

## What is an AI Agent?

An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a system that **autonomously performs tasks** by designing workflows and **using tools**. 
Beyond processing language, these agents make decisions, solve problems, interact with environments, and execute actions. 
They are widely used in areas like IT automation, software design, and conversational assistants. 
Leveraging large language models (LLMs), AI agents process user inputs step-by-step and call external tools as needed to tackle 
complex tasks effectively.

## What Makes Jupyter AI Agent Unique?

This agent is **innovative** as it is designed to **operate on the entire notebook**, not just at the cell level, enabling more comprehensive and seamless modifications.

This powerful functionality is made possible through [jupyter-nbmodel-client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-nbmodel-client) and [jupyter-kernel-client](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client), enabling interaction with Jupyter Notebooks and Kernels.

:::warning

jupyter-nbmodel-client and jupyter-kernel-client are experimental and under active development.
Unexpected behavior such as ["Panic Exception"](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-nbmodel-client/issues/12) may occur, due to potential issue generated by 3rd party projects.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Notebook Interaction**: Jupyter AI agents can add, edit, and execute cells dynamically based on user instructions or notebook events.
- **Remote Agent Execution**: The agent can be executed independently, remotely on a different kernel than the one used by the notebook of interest to separate the agent execution from the notebook execution. Refer to "Deployment modes" in [Usage](/docs/interactions) for more details.
- **Event-Based Modifications**: Can react to kernel and notebook changes in real time, enabling modifications without user intervention. Refer to "Interaction modes" in [Usage](/docs/interactions) for more details.
- **Advanced Jupyter Tools**: Includes current capabilities like inserting markdown or code cells, running code.
- **Integration with RTC**: Real-Time Collaboration ensures seamless agent modifications in JupyterLab.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Analysi**s: Generate and execute Python scripts to analyze data, create visualizations, or preprocess datasets.
- **Error Debugging**: Identify and explain errors in code execution, with actionable suggestions to fix them.
- **Notebook Refactoring**: Automatically optimize code structure, improve readability, or add detailed documentation.

Discover the current agents available in the Jupyter AI Agent framework on the [Agents](/docs/agents/) page.

## Tools

### Current Tools

- **Add Code Cell**: Dynamically add new code cells to the notebook.
- **Execute Code Cell**: Run code within specific cells, providing instant results.
- **Add Markdown Cell**: Insert markdown cells to structure and document notebooks effectively.

### Upcoming Tools (Ideas)

- **Modify Code Cell**: Edit existing code cells to fix errors or improve code quality.
- **Add Code Cell at a specific position**: Insert code cells at a specific location in the notebook.
- **Add Markdown Cell at a specific position**: Insert markdown cells at a specific location in the notebook.
- ...

## Potential Directions

- **Creating a UI for Chatting with the Agent in JupyterLab**: Developing an interactive interface within JupyterLab 
where users can directly communicate with the Jupyter AI Agent, issuing commands and receiving real-time responses 
in a conversational format.
- **Building a Code Refactoring Agent**: Developing an agent that can automatically refactor code in Jupyter Notebooks,
improving code quality, readability, and maintainability.

# Deployment

# Deployment Modes

The **deployment modes** refer to where the agent is running.

- `In-Kernel` - When installed in the kernels, the agent can be requested directly. This is not the recommended way and should be used only for development purposes.
- `Out-Kernel Stateless` - A CLI for example, with that option it is not possible to leverage the `agent memory`, meaning that the agent is stateless and does not remember previous interactions.
- `Out-Kernel Stateful` - A separated process that is requested via e.g. REST endpoints, being able to leverage the `agent memory` features.

## JupyterLab

Make sure you have JupyterLab installed with the Collaboration extension.

```bash
pip install jupyterlab jupyter-collaboration ipykernel
```

Start JupyterLab, setting a `port` and a `token` to be reused by the agent, and create a notebook `test.ipynb`.

```bash
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN
```

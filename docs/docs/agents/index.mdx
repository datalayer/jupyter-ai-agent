# Agents

First, make sure the Jupyter AI Agent is installed (refer to the [installation guide](/docs/installation)). Make sure you understand the different [**deployment modes**](/docs/deployments) referring to where the agent is running, and the [**interactions modes**](/docs/interactions) referring to how the agent is used.

## Existing Agents

Jupyter AI Agent currently provides two agents:

- [Prompt Agent](/docs/agents/prompt): Generates code cells based on natural language input.
- [Explain Error Agent](/docs/agents/explain_error): Explains the first error encountered in a notebook.

More Jupyter AI Agent like `Code Refactor Agent`, `Documentation Agent`... can be created by extending the base class.

## Create your Agents

:::info

[LangChain Agent Framework](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent/) is used to manage the interactions between the AI model and the tools.

ðŸš§ A guide to create custom agent is under construction and will be available soon.

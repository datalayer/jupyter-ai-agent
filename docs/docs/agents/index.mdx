# Agents

Jupyter AI Agent currently provides two agents: `Prompt Agent` and `Explain Error Agent`.

:::info
[LangChain Agent Framework](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent/) is used to manage the interactions between the AI model and the tools.
:::

More Jupyter AI Agent like `Code Refactor Agent`, `Documentation Agent`, ... can be created by extending the base class.

:::note
ðŸš§ A guide to create custom agent is under construction and will be available soon.
